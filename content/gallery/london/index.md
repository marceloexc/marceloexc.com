Visited for 3 weeks (May15 -> Jun2), this was a trip provided by my school where I was given this super nice room to stay in

This was *supposed* to be a trip dedicated to computer science but in reality I was just fucking around a lot. But the portion where we went to computer museums was still really fun. The plane ticket was not provided and it was expensive AF :(

Film pictures taken with [Ricoh R1]({{< relref "/tags/ricoh-r1">}}), and I used either Kodak Gold 200, Kodak Portra 800, or Ilford HP5. I'm too lazy to tag each picture with their film stock but you can just look at them and be able to tell.
