This is a very hard camera to get good pictures with. It is also the only surviving camera that has stayed within my family, as there are still some pictures that date back to 2001, which is when my Dad took them. It falls in the weird middle area where it's not "good" enough to be a popular choice for people looking for a [nostalgic vintage digicam](https://reddit.com/r/VintageDigitalCameras/), but its not old enough to be a part of the "classics".

On many days it's too bulky to carry around for such low image quality but it still holds some charm
