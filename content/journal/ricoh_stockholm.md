### My Ricoh R1 is broken again

~4 months after I got my Ricoh back from repairs, its broken again.

My first real issue was that after my [London]({{< relref "/gallery/london/" >}}) trip, the shutter board broke, which means that it is impossible to take a photo. I only learned of this the day before my Mexico City trip, right before I was about to put a new roll of film in. I turn it on and press the shutter...silence....i couldn't even hear the click from the light meter

If you're in the market for a ricoh r1, this is probably not an issue that you will face - the main epidemic of these cameras is that they will have their top LCD fail. Doing an ebay search for these cameras, around ~80% of these have a bad LCD and are noted so in the listing description or in the title. I overpaid a bit to have one with a good LCD, but i too eventually got it replaced down the line

### Why this may be a good thing

One trope of the """"""analog community""""" is that a camera will sit on the shelves for cheap, someone picks it up, goes online to show the world how such an UNDERRATED and INEXPENSIVE camera can be so GOOD, which in turn will make the camera rise up in price in the used market before it's unattainable for "normal" people just wanting to get into the hobby. 

I fully expected the same to happen to the Ricoh R1. this is probably the most compact point and shoot film camera (much thinner than any digital ricoh gr cameras afaik) and the light meter can read your mind. I was waiting for the inevitable future where this camera costs $300, but it has actually gone _down_ in price.
