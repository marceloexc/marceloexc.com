I think a pretty good motivator for learning how to draw is to analyze how artists paint a pretty picture. Thus, I give you:

## A list of artists with amazing style and technique to get lost in:

* [Artyom Trakhanov](https://ohotnig.gumroad.com/), AKA [@vor_bokor](https://twitter.com/vor_bokor) on Twitter (Which is where I found him).

* [Plastiboo](https://plastiboo.carrd.co), oozes this analog grungineess that looks like it came from an underground 1990's sci-fi zine. [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/plastiboo), [Tumblr](https://plastiboo.tumblr.com/). Part of the Hollow Press collective
