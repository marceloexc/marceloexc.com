## The Three Ways To Do Color Calibration
* Color calibration
	* Most commonly known for setting **white balance** - can also be used to change color of image
	* Contains **color mixer**
* Color Zones
	* Has the ability to change just **one color of the image** to another color - like changing the *red* terracota roofs of a house to a green roof or a *purple* roof
* Color balance RGB
	* 4 ways
		* Global Offset -> Deals with darkest parts of image
		* Power -> Deals with midtones
		* The rest (Shadows lift and Highlights lift) are self defined and do exactly as they are titled
	* Tips
		1. Within **4 ways** - don't set the chroma too high, you can always add more saturation within the "master" tab


## General Scene-referred Workflow (First thing you do when you first load up an image)
1. Lens correction (Select lens if necessary)
2. Chromatic Abberation (check if this has affected any other color first)
3. Exposure (Set to something neutral, not something too dark or too light as you will be changing that with other methods)
4. Filmic RGB - set white and black points as well as contrast with how both sets of colors will interact with each other
5. Color balance - This is the lightroom version of HSL - set saturation with different parts of image and *give* or *take* different colors away aswell
6. Tone Equalizer (not needed) - bringing detail to different parts of image (Highlights, mids, shadows) without affecting others too much
