## Stuff that I need to implement
By the way is my h3 way too small?

* Table of contents for each page
	* This also requires me to get into anchors, and so far i have no idea how to do that
* Python script that automatically creates screenshots from a page, and outputs it to a sensible file format?
**Useful for my "Favorite Websites" Page**
	
my thing:
```yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser firefox "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=LL" --all-subs --embed-subs --merge-output-format mkv   --download-archive archive.txt --write-info-json```
