## About the "minimal" web
I certainly don't think that my website qualifies as anything for "minimal" or "permanent". I occasionally forget to compress 4mb images and I use a lot of CSS3 that some older browsers may not support. Nevertheless I think that reading up on some of these could give a good understanding of the importace for staying simple with HTML/CSS
* [Homebrew Club](https://homebrewserver.club) - Appreciating the liberty of self hosting from home instead of relying on a data center. A lot of my stuff is self-hosted, like my 24/7 Jellyfin instance...but this website isn't at the moment (it uses vultr). That could change!!!!!
## Portfolio Websites
These are mainly "personal" websites, stuff that has an about page, some projects, or just have a cool design. I list sites here that are either very cool in design, have a lot of content, or mainly because I think the person hosting it is cool
* [Six Eyes](https://sixey.es/)- About page says that the website is a *place* and its very accurate. Easy to get lost and the dedication taken on the website is amazing.
* [Northern Info](https://nor.the-rn.info/) - Home page gives me [Milwaukee Protocol vibes](https://vcjd.bandcamp.com/album/milwaukee-protocol). "*Northern Information is the abstraction of artist Tyler Etters.*"
* [Provoke Analogue](https://www.provokeanalog.com/) - main website of [rupert@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@rupert). Not really a portfolio but theres a lot of cool pictures here.
* [Bad Diode](https://badd10de.dev/) - A lot of good information about programming and music comp
* [Devine Lu Linvega (XXIIVV)](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html) - Probably the most interesting portfolio site on here, a lot of content. Devine says they wanted the site to feel like a playground and I think it succeeded.
* [Detondev](https://detondev.com/) - No idea what this is. Looks cool though
* [Nezu World](https://nezu.world/) - People who can be musicians, artists, and programmers at the same time are wizards in my eyes
* [Novov](https://novov.me/) - Has a lot of interesting content
* [Unascribed](https://unascribed.com/) - Really playful design and works on a lot of Java-related projects
* [Adel Faure](https://adelfaure.net/) - The ASCII art is a treat...!
## Resource websites
Mainly websites that usually have **one** goal in mind and it is to teach you **something**. Most of these are programming related.
### Programming
* CSS
	* https://smolcss.dev/
	* https://moderncss.dev/
* [Think Like A Git](https://think-like-a-git.net/) - Helps teach the git CLI and its inner-workings
### Design
* [Fuck the system, teach yourself (how to make fonts) (for free!)](https://designrants.substack.com/p/05-fuck-the-system-teach-yourself)
* [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) - Publishes great content about design, web development, and the overlap between the two. Also the website just looks very nice in general
### Art
* [Alta Plana](https://www.altaplana.be/en/start) - I have no idea what this is.
### Music
* [Heckscaper](https://heckscaper.com/main.html) - MANY music resources can be found here (stems, plugins, etc), mostly (or all?) for free
## Just plain cool sites
