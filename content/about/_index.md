### ...me

My name is Marcelo Mendez, I'm based in McAllen, Texas. I'm currently in university for CS.

Dreams I have:

* A phone that lasts twenty years

* A robot with a CD Player as a heart

* A small computer that lives in the attic of each home, providing self-hosted and self-sufficient services

* New Radiohead or Brave Little Abacus album (take your pick)

Email contact is at

```

### ...what I do

* Programming

	*  I'm fluent in Python but also interested in Go, Rust, C, Common Lisp, and UXN.
	
	* I like to believe that the software I make can be useful to someone stopping by.
	
* Photography

	* I take both digital and film photos. I publish most of them online, either through this website or through my instagram
	
* Biking

* Writing

* Making (but mostly listening to) music


### ...the website
I'm not very good at making websites, but I do know what I [like](https://potato.cheap/) and what I [don't like](https://infrequently.org/2024/01/performance-inequality-gap-2024/). The only JavaScript that is used is to handle themes (which are not detrimental to the site's function). A non-SSL mirror can be found at <https://marceloexc.rf.gd>
