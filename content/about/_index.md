### ...the website
_marceloexc.com_ is my online digital playground. I have pictures, code, writings, and other random stuff. I use Hugo as my Static Site Generator, being hosted through Caddy with a [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) Debian box.

### ...about me

My name is Marcelo Mendez. I'm currently a computer science student enrolled at the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley

My hobbies include programming, listening to music, biking, and taking pictures. I started to work on this website in May 2023, and it is always in a state of (unfinishment?)

Some cool facts:
* The "EXC" in "MarceloEXC" stands for Excruciated (my Xbox gamertag from 5th grade)
* I can't pronounce the word "reciepts"
* my first computer was an iBook G4 in 2012 (i thought i was so cool)
