I have been working on this website since ~February 2023, on and off. It has been my first foray into website development from scratch (only using HTML +CSS). Hugo, the static site generator that runs the website, is a *beast* and it takes a lot of time and mistakes to figure out the right way to do stuff. 

* Most of `index.html` is actually hardcoded HTML (meaning, no markdown, and no shortcodes). This has to change, because even changing something simple like a banner image makes it a pain in the ass
* Grid-boxes instead of simple `<li>` when in list view
	* As a matter in fact, fix grid-boxes to not be so barren in the first place
