## The tools I use on a daily basis

I prefer to only use tools that are either free and open source software (FOSS), and/or don't use Electron⚛️. Not that I'm a FOSS absolutionist but because most open source projects I encounter are pressured to keep code clean, minimal, and purposeful - which all lead to software that is generally faster than proprietary counterparts. 

As for Electron, this [article does a good job explaining it](https://hyperdiskapp.com/blog/too-many-mac-apps-are-being-built-with-electron/). However, some Electron apps fall through the cracks and end up in my toolbelt

### Using the macOS Dock
![My MacOS Dock](/images/macos_dock.png)

Most of the apps that I keep on my Dock are not there because of how much I use them nor because they are a "speed dial" to open Apps faster but becasue they're the apps that I would want to use to make interesting things. 

I can tell you that I probably haven't touched [the Renoise icon](https://www.renoise.com/) in about a month, but it still sits there as a way to kind of pressure myself to think about it more, like "Aw man, I haven't made tracker music in a long time, guess I should work towards that"

Vice versa I open WhatsApp almost everyday for work stuff but I want to stay away from that as much as possible because I hate WhatsApp (unrelated, they actually switched from Electron to Catalyst Native semi-recently, and it might have gone worse..)

### Programming Tools
* JetBrains IDE's - PyCharm, IntelliJ, RustRover. These aren't anywhere near open source and they are slow, but it sets up your entire environment for you
* [Nova Text Editor](https://nova.app/) - Probably one of the better text editors for Mac and is one of the factors that I think it will be really hard for me to switch to Linux. I make my website on this!
* [Fork (Git client)](https://git-fork.com/) - Whenever I can't visualize my Git branch (or if i'm really screwed with merge conflicts) i use this.
* [iTerm2 Terminal](https://iterm2.com/) - mostly got it because the current beta has a seperate auto light / dark theme selector
* [Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)](https://fishshell.com/) - autocompletion feature is killer
* Hugo - 

### Visual Tools
* [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) - It is harder than Adobe Lightroom, slower than Adobe Lightroom, and probably uglier, but after achieving semi-mastery I could never go back to Lightroom 
* [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com/) - This is a more "lightroom-based" photo manipulator, where everything has simple dials. I sometimes use this on photos that I _really_ don't care about
* [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - I cant bring myself to use GNU-Imp, sorry. However I also hate Adobe so this will do (i actually like it more than Photoshop)
* [Blender](https://blender.org) for 3D modeling and renders. I used to use Cinema 4D in middle school but seeing the explosive development on Blender, i had to switch. Extremely steep learning curve
* [DaVinky Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - It's not Premiere
* [PureRef](https://pureref.com) - Extremely simple reference collages and extremely fast

### Audio Tools
* [Ableton Live 11](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) - Honestly i think now that FL studio is available on Mac it would probably be a better fit, but Ableton looks way cooler. 
* [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/) for making tracker music. I wish i had the motivation to use it more since i love tracker music
[plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) - Pure Data wrapper. another thing that I wish i could bring myself to use more, since [it can do a lot of cool shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_4zr0Qk6o0)
* Apple Music - its the less-worse of the two major streaming services. However I still have a lot of gripes about it and its interface (insert mario guzman toot here)
  * Another good reason to use Apple Music instead of Spotify is because sideloading Music is incredibly easy
* SoulSeek - Sometimes the music is LITERALLY not available anywhere else. I'm soon gonna take this one out of the dock because i'm selfhosting [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/) on my Mac Mini server. If you're gonna use it locally, i recommend [Nicotine Plus](https://nicotine-plus.org/) as a SLSK client

### Utilities
* [Doom Emacs + Org Mode](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) - I'm still really skeptical of Emacs as a code editor (its just way too slow), but Org mode is an absolute Godsend. I should really do a page about how I take notes on Org Mode...
* [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) - this is way better than using Preview.app for viewing PDFs.
* [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) - while i technically pay for Microsoft Office because I pay for OneDrive, i don't think ive touched the official MS Suite in years. LibreOffice is another choice too, but the scrolling performance on retina displays for macOS is really rough
  * funnily enough, even though MS Office is a native macOS app and OnlyOffice is web-based (probably not Electron, but _something_ web-based), onlyoffice still runs laps against MS Office
* [BitWarden Password Manager](https://bitwarden.com/) - solid and super stable. I don't trust myself to selfhost it though.
* [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/) - while I mostly just use CLI tools and SSH into my home server, sometimes just using the web-ui of a tool is way better. 
* [Transmit FTP Client](https://panic.com/transmit/) - i feel so bad for linux / windows users, they will never be able to experience how much better transmit is than filezilla
* [Music Widget for Apple Music](https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/) - not only for looks but genuinely useful, since the default apple music mini window is way too big and doesn't even stay on top of other windows half the time
* [NetNewsWire RSS Client](https://netnewswire.com/) - reminds me that i need to read more articles more often. Actually has the ability to read articles *within* the app, not just opening the browser to direct you to said article.
* [Ripcord (Discord Client)](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/) - Is it bad that I use this _because_ it is missing a lot of features and a little clunky to use, thus making me want to use discord less?
  * if you dont know, using a third party client is against discord TOS, they will ban your account, they will raid your house, they will send the discord ninjas after you, etc etc.
