## Tools used

My preference is for FOSS software and no [electron](https://hyperdiskapp.com/blog/too-many-mac-apps-are-being-built-with-electron/) apps but beggars can't be choosers...

### Using the macOS Dock
![My MacOS Dock](/images/dock.jpeg)

Many years ive attempted to have a "clean" dock but it never works. I also don't autohide my dock since i just find it to be more cumbersome to summon it from under the screen...its small enough that the screen real estate it takes is negligible

### Programming Tools

* JetBrains IDE's - PyCharm, IntelliJ, RustRover
* [Nova Text Editor](https://nova.app/) - Probably one of the better text editors for Mac and is one of the factors that I think it will be really hard for me to switch to Linux. I make my website on this
* [Fork (Git client)](https://git-fork.com/) - Im allergic to the `git` cli so mostly everything git related is done through here
* [iTerm2 Terminal](https://iterm2.com/) - mostly got it because the current beta has a seperate auto light / dark theme selector
* [Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)](https://fishshell.com/) - autocompletion feature is killer
* Hugo

### Visual Tools
* [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) - It is harder than Adobe Lightroom, slower than Adobe Lightroom, but i still keep coming back
* [RawTherapee](https://rawtherapee.com/) - This is a more "lightroom-based" photo manipulator, where everything has simple dials
* [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/) - My brain is photoshop-poisoned so i use the best photoshop clone there is
* [Blender](https://blender.org) for 3D modeling and renders
* [DaVinky Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) - It's not Premiere
* [PureRef](https://pureref.com) - Extremely simple reference collages and extremely fast

### Audio Tools
* [Ableton Live 11](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) 
* [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/) 
[plugdata](https://plugdata.org/) - watch the [cool shit you can do with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_4zr0Qk6o0)
* Apple Music
* SoulSeek

### Utilities
* [Doom Emacs + Org Mode](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)
* [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) - better than preview.app for pdf's
* [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) - faster than the official microsoft office even though this is a web app. Lol
* [BitWarden Password Manager](https://bitwarden.com/)
* [Transmit FTP Client](https://panic.com/transmit/) - most goated ftp client
* [Music Widget for Apple Music](https://marioaguzman.github.io/musicwidget/) - not only for looks but genuinely useful, since the default apple music mini window is way too big and doesn't even stay on top of other windows half the time
* [NetNewsWire RSS Client](https://netnewswire.com/)
* [Ripcord (Discord Client)](https://cancel.fm/ripcord/) - fastest discord client, but also abandoned
