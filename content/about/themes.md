This website has many themes available, with `salmon` being the default  theme ([it's one of my favorites]({{< relref "/projects/theme_ports">}})), however I try to bring a variety of both light and dark themes

Instead of the theme data being in a typical format like `json`, they are actually `svg` files which bring the benefit of  *being able to see what the theme is* before applying them to the site. This is called [the Hundred Rabbits theme system](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes).
%%  TODO - figsrc shortcode   %%

This website is using the Hundred Rabbits theme system, [available here](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes). This is the only portion of the website that uses JavaScript.
