How does the theme system work??? Fuck if i know???? Test test test1234


My super awesome super cool swag yolo website has many themes. If you're on a big screen then they should be on the left side of the screen and if you're on a phone or something they should be at the bottom. 

The themes are implemented through just being SVG files, which is [the Hundred Rabbits theme system](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes).

This website is using the Hundred Rabbits theme system, [available here](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Themes). This is the only portion of the website that uses JavaScript.
